# Georgios-Homework-Tree
Homework on data structures and Binary Research Trees.
This is an assignement given to us over the last lessons
it's about building a data management solution based on BST's.

---

The requirements for this assignement are:

1. Build a data management solution, similar to the first exercise, based on BSTs. Think of appropriate attributes in each case. You can use an auxiliary data structure too.
2. Implement Supported actions: Search/retrieval, Insertion, Deletion
3. Implement a version of Merge Sort, to sort your data structure based on a "sortable" attribute (e.g. year of enrolment, name)
4. Support any function that depends on search (retrieval, updating and removal), with your implementation of Binary Search (or, optionally, a suitable tree structure).
5. The tree should be self-balancing!

Maintain a public remote repository on GitHub, with just the necessary documentation on how to build and run your code.

Include a short description about what your project does and what limitations it may have (bugs, unfinished tasks, etc.).

To run the program: 

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/EmilienChinsy/Georgios-Homework-Tree
2. Locate and navigate to the location of the now local repository cd Georgios-Homework-Tree
3. Compile the program using `g++ main.cpp -o main.o`
4. execute the program using ./main.o
